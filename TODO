Make faster
    Swap motors
    Reduce lag compensation
    Dropoff / pickup sequence faster
    Have an additional speed setting: SLEW,
    which goes as fast as physically possible.
Don't crop corners
Go over ramp towards pickup
    Lift up the arm to go over the bridge
Timer


LAG COMPENSATION:
    Maybe ask the Arduino whether it's ready to receive a command
    as well as checking if it's stopped moving on the video feed.

FASTER:
Send a list of up to 10 commands at once
    5 variables per command
        Left, Right, Servo, Duration, Blink colour
    Read 5 variables at a time,
    then shift all the data left by 5.

    Arduino code:
        wt.listen(), handle new command
        after timeout expires, shift data left, look for new commands.
        Have a counter of how many new commands were received.

    Python code:
        Skip all of the following if a flag is set

        Function returns the expected ending position after a command
        Keep calling the waypoint with the expected position,
        until it's completed.

        Make an object to store hardcoded commands
        Flags determine whether colour should be checked etc.

List of waypoint groups:

Corner: 16s
    { 4.0s
        Go to before corner wp
    }
    { 3.0s
        Go to 1st corner wp
    }
    { 2.0s
        Go to 2nd corner wp
        Turn to face next wp
    }
    { 3.0s
        Go to after corner wp
    }

Pickup block 9.3s
    { 5.0s
        Approach block 8000ms
    }
    { 0.2s
        Sense background, 0ms
        Move forward, 200ms
    }
    { 1.1s
        Sense block, 0ms (and light up LED by yourself, send it the threshold, not the colour to light up)
        Move backward, 200ms (may have to pause longer for competition rules)
        Turn towards block 200ms
        Go to block_wp 500ms
        Close gate 200ms
        Move backward, 500ms
    }

Dropoff block 10s
    { 3.0s
        Go to before dropoff
        Turn to face next wp
    }
    { 3.0s
        Accurately place the block
    }
    { 1.0s
        Open gate, 500ms
        Reverse away 500ms
    }
