A brief comparison of different block pickup mechanisms

# Criteria

- Insensitive to block orientation

- Small footprint (can work near walls)

# Scoop

Flip the block up onto a scoop, then carry it around, and drop it off when needed.

- Sensitive to block orientation

- Could work over the bridge

# Diagonal pusher with gate

Push the block around, and have a gate in front of the block to prevent it from leaving early. Push the block diagonally so that it's less likely to get caught on the tape on the table. Open the gate + reverse the robot to release.

- Insensitive to block orientation (block will naturally settle to correct orientation while the robot moves around)

- Only works going around the sides

# Grabber

Have two claws geared to spin in opposite directions. Grab the block by closing the claws. Release the block by opening the claws. May be able to also lift up the block using a servo.

- Could be made insensitive to block orientation

- Could work going over the bridge
