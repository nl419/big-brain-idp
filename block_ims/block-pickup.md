# Criteria

- Insensitive to block orientation

- Small footprint (can work near walls)

# Scoop

- Sensitive to block orientation

- Could work over the bridge

# Diagonal pusher with gate

- Insensitive to block orientation (block will naturally settle to correct orientation while the robot moves around)

- Only works going around the sides

# Grabber

- Could be made insensitive to block orientation

- Could work going over the bridge
